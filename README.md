# finding-donors-for-charity
Finding donors for charity using supervised learning algorithms. Predicts an individual's income in order to find who would be best suited for requesting donations from.

This project compares three different supervised learning models. The three models are random trees, naive bayes, and ensemble learning (specifically an AdaBoost Classifier). The comparison of the three different models can be viewed below.

The dataset for this project originates from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article "Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid". You can find the article by Ron Kohavi online.
